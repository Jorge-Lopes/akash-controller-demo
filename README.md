# Akash controller Demo

This repository codebase was designed to showcase the capabilities of the [dapp-akash-controller](https://github.com/simpletrontdip/dapp-akash-controller). The original code has been carefully adapted and modified to ensure compatibility with a more recent SDK version.
   
The agoric-sdk version used during its development was `0.18.2`, and the current commit in its Git repository is `agoric-upgrade-8-326-g65d3f14c8` of the `community-dev` branch.

Please note that this repository serves as a demonstration, which guide and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Jorge-Lopes/agoric-components/tree/main/akash-controller), and the code is intended for illustrative purposes only. 

Feel free to explore, experiment, and provide feedback. We appreciate your valuable input.

Happy coding and exploring!
